        1. Follow a daily routine </h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Coming up with a structured plan for each day with clear boundaries between your working and private life
        will give you a sense of control amid the uncertainty.
        Try to divide your day into small activities and make sure you build in time to do things you enjoy, from
        pursuing your hobbies or exercising to spending time with your children or pets.
        Moreover, set a daily routine for work: take regular breaks, leave your desk for lunch, and have a fixed time to
        turn off.
        Additionally, focus on getting enough sleep and regularly eating healthy meal

        2. Exercise</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">

        Physical activity can do wonders for your mental health – especially if you are feeling stressed. The World
        Health Organisation (WHO) recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity
        physical activity per week – or if you are very motivated, a combination of both. That’s as little as 15 minutes
        a day! WHO suggests these fitness tips to exercise at home:

        Take short active breaks throughout the day: from performing domestic chores to playing with your children,
        short sessions of physical activities will keep you busy.
        Follow an online exercise class: thanks to the internet, there is a huge selection of online exercise courses,
        many of them are for free and can be found on YouTube.
        Walk: this tip may be simple, but it is still effective. Even at home, walking around will help you to remain
        active. If you have a call, for example, stand or walk around instead of sitting down.
        Stand up: the WHO recommends standing up every 30 minutes to reduce your sedentary time. If you are working from
        home, consider setting up a standing desk. During leisure time, follow cognitively stimulating activities:
        reading, board games or puzzles.
        Relax: Meditation and breathing exercises can help you to better cope with stress.

        3. Set limits around news on COVID-19</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Excessively checking updates of coronavirus news can leave you stressed and emotionally exhausted. Try to make a
        conscious effort to disconnect and build healthy news habits: turn off push notifications from news apps, seek
        factual information from trusted sources and set specific times for checking the news (i.e. once in the morning
        and evening). Watch the news with others to discuss any worries you might have and to avoid anxious thoughts
        going unchecked. Another tip is to look for positive, uplifting stories and good news amid the pandemic.
        Celebrating positive stories can boost your mood and wellbeing.

        4. Limit your social media intake</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">

        7. Limit your social media intake
        On the one hand, social media is a great way to connect with others. On the other hand, it can amplify anxiety
        and stress with a constant flow of worrisome (mis)information. Therefore, be careful about your social media
        use: consider turning off push notifications, unfollowing or muting accounts which are triggering for you,
        muting WhatsApp groups and hiding Facebook posts and feeds that might overwhelm you. A lot of devices nowadays
        even offer a function to notify you once you’ve reached your daily time limit of social media use.

    <h3
        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        5. Reach out to others</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Without social interactions provided by going into the office, working from home can feel lonely and
        isolating. Making time to reach out and connect with others is important for our mental health. Socialising
        decreases stress and anxiety while supporting calm and happy feelings. By talking to someone, we share our
        emotions and experiences, provide or receive support which makes us feel connected. When we socialise and
        have physical proximity to others, we reduce cortisol levels. Simply sharing our concerns with a loved one
        can help us feel better.



        Talking to a friend or family member can be a helpful way to keep your stress levels under control. Plan at
        least one connection a day – a phone call or a chat with a colleague or friend who you can share experiences
        with. Consider regular virtual meetings with family and friends to check in on each other. This can be a
        great source of support during these times.
