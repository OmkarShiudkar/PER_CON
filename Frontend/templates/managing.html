        1. Meet yourself where you are
        Depression is common. It affects millions of people, including some in your life. You may not realize they face
        similar challenges, emotions, and obstacles.

        Every day with this disorder is different. It’s important to take your mental health seriously and accept that
        where you are right now isn’t where you’ll always be.

        The key to self-treatment for depression is to be open, accepting, and loving toward yourself and what you’re
        going through.

        2. If you need to wallow, wallow — but do so constructively
        Suppressing your feelings and emotions may seem like a strategic way to cope with the negative symptoms of
        depression. But this technique is ultimately unhealthy.

        If you’re having a down day, have it. Let yourself feel the emotions — but don’t stay there.

        Consider writing or journaling about what you’re experiencing. Then, when the feelings lift, write about that,
        too.

        Seeing the ebb and flow of depressive symptoms can be instructive for both self-healing and hope.

        3. Know that today isn’t indicative of tomorrow
        Today’s mood, emotions, or thoughts don’t belong to tomorrow.

        If you were unsuccessful at getting out of bed or accomplishing your goals today, remember that you haven’t lost
        tomorrow’s opportunity to try again.

        Give yourself the grace to accept that while some days will be difficult, some days will also be great. Try to
        look forward to tomorrow’s fresh start.

        4. Assess the parts instead of generalizing the whole
        Depression can tinge recollections with negative emotions. You may find yourself focusing on the one thing that
        went wrong instead of the many things that went right.

        Try to stop this overgeneralization. Push yourself to recognize the good. If it helps, write down what was happy
        about the event or day. Then write down what went wrong.

        Seeing the weight you’re giving to one thing may help you direct your thoughts away from the whole and to the
        individual pieces that were positive.

        5. Do the opposite of what the ‘depression voice’ suggests
        The negative, irrational voice in your head may talk you out of self-help. However, if you can learn to
        recognize it, you can learn to replace it. Use logic as a weapon. Address each thought individually as it
        occurs.

        If you believe an event won’t be fun or worth your time, say to yourself, “You might be right, but it’ll be
        better than just sitting here another night.” You may soon see the negative isn’t always realistic.

        6. Set attainable goals
        A lengthy to-do list may be so weighty that you’d rather do nothing. Instead of compiling a long list of tasks,
        consider setting one or two smaller goals.

        For example:

        Don’t clean the house; take the trash out.
        Don’t do all the laundry that’s piled up; just sort the piles by color.
        Don’t clear out your entire email inbox; just address any time-sensitive messages.
        When you’ve done a small thing, set your eyes on another small thing, and then another. This way, you have a
        list of tangible achievements and not an untouched to-do list.

    </h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        7. Reward your efforts
        All goals are worthy of recognition, and all successes are worthy of celebration. When you achieve a goal, do
        your best to recognize it.

        You may not feel like celebrating with a cake and confetti, but recognizing your own successes can be a very
        powerful weapon against depression’s negative weight.

        The memory of a job well-done may be especially powerful against negative talk and overgeneralization.

        8. You may find it helpful to create a routine
        If depressive symptoms disrupt your daily routine, setting a gentle schedule may help you feel in control. But
        these plans don’t have to map out an entire day.

        Focus on times when you feel the most disorganized or scattered.

        Your schedule could focus on the time before work or right before bed. Perhaps it’s only for the weekends. Focus
        on creating a loose, but structured, routine that can help you keep your daily pace going.

        9. Do something you enjoy…
        Depression can push you to give into your fatigue. It may feel more powerful than happy emotions.

        Try to push back and do something you love — something that’s relaxing, but energizing. It could be playing an
        instrument, painting, hiking, or biking.

        These activities can provide subtle lifts in your mood and energy, which may help you overcome your symptoms.

        11. Or spend time in nature
        Mother Nature can have a powerful influence on depression. ResearchTrusted Source suggests people who spend time
        in nature have improved mental health.

        Exposure to sunlight may offer some of the same benefits. It can increase your serotonin levels, which can
        provide a temporary mood boostTrusted Source.

        Consider taking a walk at lunch among the trees or spending some time in your local park. Or plan a weekend
        hike. These activities can help you reconnect with nature and soak in some rays at the same time.

        12. Or spend time with loved ones
        Depression can tempt you to isolate yourself and withdraw from your friends and family, but face-to-face time
        can help wash away those tendencies.

        If you’re unable to spend time together in person, phone calls or video chats can also be helpful.

        Try to remind yourself these people care about you. Resist the temptation to feel like you’re a burden. You need
        the interaction — and they likely do, too.

        13. Try something new entirely
        When you do the same thing day after day, you use the same parts of your brain. You can challenge your neurons
        and alter your brain chemistry by doing something entirely different.

        Research also shows doing new things can improve your overall well-being and strengthen your social
        relationships.

        To reap these benefits, consider trying a new sport, taking a creative class, or learning a new cooking
        technique.

        Knock out a few birds with one stone — spending time with other people and doing something new — by volunteering
        and giving your time to someone or something else.

        You may be used to receiving help from friends, but reaching out and providing help may actually improve your
        mental health more.

        Bonus: People who volunteer experience physical benefits, too. This includes a reduced risk of hypertension.

        When you do something you love, or even when you find a new activity you enjoy, you may be able to boost your
        mental health more by taking time to be thankful for it.

        Research shows gratitude can have lasting positive effects on your overall mental health.

        Stress and anxiety can prolong your depression symptoms. Finding relaxation techniques can help you lower stress
        and invite more joy and balance into your day.

        Research suggests activities like meditation, yoga, deep breathing, and even journaling may help you improve
        your sense of well-being and feel more connected to what’s happening around you.

        17. What you eat and drink can also affect how you feel
        There’s no magic diet that will treat depression. But what you put into your body can have a real and
        significant impact on the way you feel.

        Eating a diet rich in lean meats, vegetables, and grains may be a great place to start. Try to limit stimulants
        like caffeine, coffee, and soda, and depressants like alcohol.

        Some people also feel betterTrusted Source and have more energy when they avoid sugar, preservatives, and
        processed foods.

        If you have the means, consider meeting with a doctor or registered dietitian for guidance.

        18. If you’re up for exercise, consider a walk around the block
        On days when you feel as if you can’t get out of bed, exercise may seem like the last thing you’d want to do.
        However, exercise and physical activity can be powerful depression fighters.

        Research suggests that, for some people, exercise can be as effective as medication at relieving depression
        symptoms. It may also help prevent future depressive episodes.

        If you’re able to, take a walk around the block. Start with a five-minute walk and work your way up from there.

        Sleep disturbances are common with depression. You may not sleep well, or you may sleep too much. Both can make
        depression symptoms worse.

        Aim for eight hours of sleep per night. Try to get into a healthy sleeping routine.

        Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help you with your daily schedule. Getting the proper
        amount of sleep may also help you feel more balanced and energized throughout your day.

        20. Consider clinical treatment
        You may also find it helpful to speak to a professional about what you’re going through. A general practitioner
        may be able to refer you to a therapist or other specialist.

        They can assess your symptoms and help develop a clinical treatment plan tailored to your needs. This may
        include traditional options, such as medication and therapy, or alternative measures, such as acupuncture.

        Finding the right treatment for you may take some time, so be open with your provider about what is and isn’t
        working. Your provider will work with you to find the best option.</p>
