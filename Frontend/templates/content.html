<h3>Anxiety</h3>
                            <p>Try these when you're feeling anxious or stressed:

Take a time-out. Practice yoga, listen to music, meditate, get a massage, or learn relaxation techniques. Stepping back from the problem helps clear your head.
Eat well-balanced meals.  Do not skip any meals. Do keep healthful, energy-boosting snacks on hand.
Limit alcohol and caffeine, which can aggravate anxiety and trigger panic attacks.
Get enough sleep. When stressed, your body needs additional sleep and rest.
Exercise daily to help you feel good and maintain your health. Check out the fitness tips below.
Take deep breaths. Inhale and exhale slowly.
Count to 10 slowly. Repeat, and count to 20 if necessary.
Do your best. Instead of aiming for perfection, which isn't possible, be proud of however close you get.
Accept that you cannot control everything. Put your stress in perspective: Is it really as bad as you think?
Welcome humor. A good laugh goes a long way.
Maintain a positive attitude. Make an effort to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.
Get involved. Volunteer or find another way to be active in your community, which creates a support network and gives you a break from everyday stress.
Learn what triggers your anxiety. Is it work, family, school, or something else you can identify? Write in a journal when you’re feeling stressed or anxious, and look for a pattern.
Talk to someone. Tell friends and family you’re feeling overwhelmed, and let them know how they can help you. Talk to a physician or therapist for professional help.
 
Fitness Tips: Stay Healthy, Manage Stress
For the biggest benefits of exercise, try to include at least 2½ hours of moderate-intensity physical activity (e.g. brisk walking) each week, 1¼ hours of a vigorous-intensity activity (such as jogging or swimming laps), or a combination of the two.

5 X 30: Jog, walk, bike, or dance three to five times a week for 30 minutes.
Set small daily goals and aim for daily consistency rather than perfect workouts. It's better to walk every day for 15-20 minutes than to wait until the weekend for a three-hour fitness marathon. Lots of scientific data suggests that frequency is most important.
Find forms of exercise that are fun or enjoyable. Extroverted people often like classes and group activities. People who are more introverted often prefer solo pursuits.
Distract yourself with an iPod or other portable media player to download audiobooks, podcasts, or music. Many people find it’s more fun to exercise while listening to something they enjoy.
Recruit an “exercise buddy.” It's often easier to stick to your exercise routine when you have to stay committed to a friend, partner, or colleague.
Be patient when you start a new exercise program. Most sedentary people require about four to eight weeks to feel coordinated and sufficiently in shape so that exercise feels easier.</p>

                                    1. Meet yourself where you are
        Depression is common. It affects millions of people, including some in your life. You may not realize they face similar challenges, emotions, and obstacles.
        
        Every day with this disorder is different. It’s important to take your mental health seriously and accept that where you are right now isn’t where you’ll always be.
        
        The key to self-treatment for depression is to be open, accepting, and loving toward yourself and what you’re going through.
        
        2. If you need to wallow, wallow — but do so constructively
        Suppressing your feelings and emotions may seem like a strategic way to cope with the negative symptoms of depression. But this technique is ultimately unhealthy.
        
        If you’re having a down day, have it. Let yourself feel the emotions — but don’t stay there.
        
        Consider writing or journaling about what you’re experiencing. Then, when the feelings lift, write about that, too.
        
        Seeing the ebb and flow of depressive symptoms can be instructive for both self-healing and hope.
        
        3. Know that today isn’t indicative of tomorrow
        Today’s mood, emotions, or thoughts don’t belong to tomorrow.
        
        If you were unsuccessful at getting out of bed or accomplishing your goals today, remember that you haven’t lost tomorrow’s opportunity to try again.
        
        Give yourself the grace to accept that while some days will be difficult, some days will also be great. Try to look forward to tomorrow’s fresh start.
        
        4. Assess the parts instead of generalizing the whole
        Depression can tinge recollections with negative emotions. You may find yourself focusing on the one thing that went wrong instead of the many things that went right.
        
        Try to stop this overgeneralization. Push yourself to recognize the good. If it helps, write down what was happy about the event or day. Then write down what went wrong.
        
        Seeing the weight you’re giving to one thing may help you direct your thoughts away from the whole and to the individual pieces that were positive.
        
        5. Do the opposite of what the ‘depression voice’ suggests
        The negative, irrational voice in your head may talk you out of self-help. However, if you can learn to recognize it, you can learn to replace it. Use logic as a weapon. Address each thought individually as it occurs.
        
        If you believe an event won’t be fun or worth your time, say to yourself, “You might be right, but it’ll be better than just sitting here another night.” You may soon see the negative isn’t always realistic.
        
        6. Set attainable goals
        A lengthy to-do list may be so weighty that you’d rather do nothing. Instead of compiling a long list of tasks, consider setting one or two smaller goals.
        
        For example:
        
        Don’t clean the house; take the trash out.
        Don’t do all the laundry that’s piled up; just sort the piles by color.
        Don’t clear out your entire email inbox; just address any time-sensitive messages.
        When you’ve done a small thing, set your eyes on another small thing, and then another. This way, you have a list of tangible achievements and not an untouched to-do list.
        
        7. Reward your efforts
        All goals are worthy of recognition, and all successes are worthy of celebration. When you achieve a goal, do your best to recognize it.
        
        You may not feel like celebrating with a cake and confetti, but recognizing your own successes can be a very powerful weapon against depression’s negative weight.
        
        The memory of a job well-done may be especially powerful against negative talk and overgeneralization.
        
        8. You may find it helpful to create a routine
        If depressive symptoms disrupt your daily routine, setting a gentle schedule may help you feel in control. But these plans don’t have to map out an entire day.
        
        Focus on times when you feel the most disorganized or scattered.
        
        Your schedule could focus on the time before work or right before bed. Perhaps it’s only for the weekends. Focus on creating a loose, but structured, routine that can help you keep your daily pace going.
        
        9. Do something you enjoy…
        Depression can push you to give into your fatigue. It may feel more powerful than happy emotions.
        
        Try to push back and do something you love — something that’s relaxing, but energizing. It could be playing an instrument, painting, hiking, or biking.
        
        These activities can provide subtle lifts in your mood and energy, which may help you overcome your symptoms.

        12. Or spend time with loved ones

        If you’re unable to spend time together in person, phone calls or video chats can also be helpful.
        
        Try to remind yourself these people care about you. Resist the temptation to feel like you’re a burden. You need the interaction — and they likely do, too.
        
        13. Try something new entirely
        When you do the same thing day after day, you use the same parts of your brain. You can challenge your neurons and alter your brain chemistry by doing something entirely different.
        
        Research also shows doing new things can improve your overall well-being and strengthen your social relationships.
        
        To reap these benefits, consider trying a new sport, taking a creative class, or learning a new cooking technique.
        
        14. Volunteering can be a great way to do both

        Bonus: People who volunteer experience physical benefits, too. This includes a reduced risk of hypertension.
        
        15. You can also use this as a way to practice gratitude

        Research shows gratitude can have lasting positive effects on your overall mental health.
        
        What’s more, writing down your gratitude — including writing notes to others — can be particularly meaningful.
        
        16. Incorporating meditation may help ground your thoughts

        17. What you eat and drink can also affect how you feel
        There’s no magic diet that will treat depression. But what you put into your body can have a real and significant impact on the way you feel.
        
        Eating a diet rich in lean meats, vegetables, and grains may be a great place to start. Try to limit stimulants like caffeine, coffee, and soda, and depressants like alcohol.
        
        Some people also feel betterTrusted Source and have more energy when they avoid sugar, preservatives, and processed foods.
