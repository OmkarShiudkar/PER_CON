        Being depressed can leave you feeling low in energy, which might put you off being more active.
        Regular exercise can boost your mood if you have depression, and it's especially useful for people with mild to
        moderate depression.
        "Any type of exercise is useful, as long as it suits you and you do enough of it," says Dr Alan Cohen, a GP with
        a special interest in mental health.<br>
