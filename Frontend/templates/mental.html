        1. Respect the limits of your own body.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        <br>Can you bring your nose to touch your knee in Standing forward bend? Some people can bend more than others
        can. So bend only to your capacity. Love your body and respect the limits of your own body. You need not compare
        yourself with your neighbor or someone on TV.

        The thumb rule is to remain stable and comfortable in the yoga asanas. Neither push too hard and try to overdo
        things, nor be lazy. Do as much as you can - comfortably and with stability.

        2. Use the Yogic smile-meter</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        <br>Do Yoga with a sense of joy. When you overdo a stretch, smile will be the first thing to vanish. If you are
        not smiling, know that you are not doing something right. Either you are stretching too much or you are not
        comfortable. Re-adjust your body to get your beautiful smile back. With regular practice, you will find a big
        improvement.

        Warm up: Do some sun salutations or some gentle exercises to loosen up before formally going deeper into other
        Yoga Asanas.

        3.Get the Yogic attitude. Go within.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">While doing yoga postures, using specific rhythms of the breath links the breath and the
        body. Keeping the attention on where the stretch is happening; this links the body and mind. The body, breath,
        and mind come together in harmony during yoga asana. This yogic attitude helps deepen your yoga practice.

        Meditation</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        <br>It helps change your response to negative thinking
        Depression can involve a lot of dark thoughts. You might feel hopeless, worthless, or angry at life (or even
        yourself). This can make meditation seem somewhat counterintuitive, since it involves increasing awareness
        around thoughts and experiences.

        But meditation teaches you to pay attention to thoughts and feelings without passing judgment or criticizing
        yourself.

        Meditation doesn’t involve pushing away these thoughts or pretending you don’t have them. Instead, you notice
        and accept them, then let them go. In this way, meditation can help disrupt cycles of negative thinking.
        These simple steps can help you get started:

        1. Get comfortable</h3><br>

    <div class="elementcontent">It’s often helpful to sit down when first learning meditation, but if you feel better
        standing up or lying down, that works, too.
        The key is to feel comfortable and relaxed. Closing your eyes can also help.

    <h3
        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        2.Begin with your breath</h3><br>

    <div class="elementcontent">Take slow, deep breaths through your nose. For several seconds, just focus on breathing.
        Pay attention to:

        how it feels to inhale
        how it feels to exhale
        the sounds of your breath
        Your thoughts might wander away from your breath, and that’s pretty normal. Just keep redirecting your focus to
        breathing whenever you catch yourself thinking about something else.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h3
        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        3. Move from breath to body</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">Eventually, begin shifting your attention from your breath to the various parts of your
        body to perform what’s known as a body scan.

        Start your body scan wherever you like. Some people find it more natural to start with their feet, while others
        prefer to start with their hands or head.

        Focus your awareness on your body, moving from one part to the next. As you continue to breathe slowly and
        deeply, note how each body part feels.

        Do any areas hurt? Or feel tense?

        If you notice an unusual or troublesome sensation, like tension or aches, you can add a visualization exercise.

        Imagine yourself sending relaxing breaths to that part of the body. Picture that tight muscle loosening and pain
        easing. Getting more comfortable with your bodily experiences and sensations can help you become more tuned in
        to changes as they come up.

        When you’ve finished scanning your body, return your focus to your breathing for as long as you need.
