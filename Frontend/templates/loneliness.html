        1. Identify the cause and how long you’ve felt lonely or isolated.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">We cannot find a solution to a problem until we better understand what the problem is
        and where it comes from.

        Acute loneliness and isolation is often the result of an immediate life change that separates us from our social
        circles or relationships.

        It may be the result of moving, a career change, a bad breakup, or a falling out with a friend or family member.

        2. Examine your reality and consider how reasonable those feelings may be.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">There is a significant problem in this society with shallow friendships and
        relationships.

        Quite a few people flock to social media to try to accumulate a large number of followers, thinking that these
        people are their friends and actually care about them.

        This is a false impression of what friendship truly is. A person may have 100,000 followers and maybe 5 of them
        are people who genuinely care about the person in the context of a friendship or relationship.

        Science is starting to take a greater look at the way social media affects our perceptions and interpersonal
        connections because of it.

        It is important to maintain reasonable expectations and identify unreasonable beliefs.

        3.Take action to push against and attempt to alleviate the loneliness.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">No problem is solved without determined action.

        Unfortunately, the depression that may accompany loneliness can make this task seem insurmountable.

        Where do you look? Where do you go? What are the ways that we can actually push back against the loneliness?

        The ability to nurture and give love can help counter the loneliness to a degree. Pets are an excellent way to
        combat general loneliness. A dog or a cat can provide joy and comfort, is generally happy to receive love, and
        will often give their attention and affections back in a pure way.

        4.Reach out for help if you feel that you can’t overcome loneliness and isolation by yourself.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">Matters of the mind are always tricky in providing perspective on, because some issues
        reach deeper than what we can handle on our own.

        There is no shame in reaching out to a mental health professional if we feel that we cannot tackle the isolation
        and loneliness on our own.


        It can be one of the hardest things we ever have to do, one of the hardest decisions we need to make for
        ourselves. Don’t allow yourself to minimize your suffering, if you are. You deserve to feel happy, connected,
        and loved.

        But, depression or traumatic experiences can make us feel like we are undeserving of connection, love,
        affection. That is a lie that mental illness can try to convince us of. Don’t listen to it!
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3
        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        5.What if I believe someone I care about is lonely or isolated?</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">Reach out to them! Don’t do it via a social media post though. Arrange a meeting or have
        a verbal conversation with the person via the phone or a chat application.

        Verbal and face-to-face conversations have more emotional and social weight behind them that can help a lonely
        person feel a bit more connected.

        So often we find ourselves in our own little world, wrapped up in our thoughts, stresses, and worries. We must
        make an effort to reach out to the people who wind up getting pushed to the edges of society and social groups
        because of their loneliness.

        And, as a lonely person, it is necessary to combat one’s own thoughts, fears, and anxiety to reach out and try
        to bridge the gap as much as we can.

        Most people are not going to notice a person who feels lonely without some deep prodding and insight. That can
        turn into a vicious cycle of negatively affirming that no one notices or cares. The issue is that the problem is
        so subtle that it can be hard to notice.

        But that doesn’t mean you are any less deserving of friends, kindness, affection, or love.
