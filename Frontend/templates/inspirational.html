                Kate MacHugh is now 25. She’s an author and clinician.
                
                But she only got to where she is now by overcoming depression as a teenager.
                
                MacHugh said she was “harassed, humiliated and cyberbullied,” during her teenage years, leading her to go from being a happy and vibrant youngster to someone more angry and “sullen.” Once she became a different person, she slowly slipped into the murky waters of depression.
                
                “It was the lowest I have ever felt in my life," she said to the National.
                
                But everything changed once she went to college. The peers who had put her down and bullied her within the walls of high school were long gone, and she could finally start focusing on what made her unique and special. Instilling confidence in herself was what got her past depression and on a path to success, she said.
                
                “I worked really hard to change the messages in my head,” MacHugh said. “I was led to believe that I was ugly, worthless, and disgusting. I internalized these messages and they became part of my identity. I began to tell myself that I was smart, loved and beautiful."

        2.Buddha and his wisdom</h3><br>
        <div class="elementcontent" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="https://www.moralstories.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/stay-calm-moral-story-676x284.jpg.webp" style="width: 100%;">
      <br>  Once Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days.
        While they were traveling, they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his
        disciples, “I am thirsty. Please get me some water from that lake there”.
<br>
        The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it, he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the
        water and, right at that moment, a bullock cart started crossing the lake right at the edge of it. As a result,
        the water became very muddy, very turbid. The disciple thought, “How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to
        drink?!” So he came back and told the Buddha, “The water in there is very muddy. I don’t think it is fit to
        drink”.
<br>
        So, the Buddha said, let us take a little rest here by the tree. After about half an hour, again Buddha asked
        the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to
        the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the
        water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to the Buddha.
<br>
        The Buddha looked at the water, and then he looked up at the disciple and said, “See, You let the water be and
        the mud settled down on its own. You got a clear water. It didn’t require any effort”.mind is also like that. When it is disturbed, just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle
        down on its own. You don’t have to put in any effort to calm it down.

        3.Stop when you are done, not when you are tired.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent" style="text-align: center;">During the gold rush, a man who had been mining in Colorado for several months quit his
        job, as he hadn’t struck gold yet and the work was becoming tiresome. He sold his equipment to another man who
        resumed mining where it had been left off. The new miner was advised by his engineer that there was gold only
        three feet away from where the first miner stopped digging.
<br>
        The engineer was right, which means the first miner was a mere three feet away from striking gold before he
        quit.Many people give up on following their
        dreams because the work becomes too difficult, tedious, or tiresome–but often, you’re closer to the finish line
        than you may think, and if you push just a little harder, you will succeed.

        4.Elements of Life</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent " style="text-align: center;">
        <div class="row"><div class="col"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTT2kLUX1Mw-wop_4pRwCSqXr-tfIy5zTOEEZJtBYoO0G_-vF3-MwkKINxOsnjbm8tIHMI&usqp=CAU"></div></div>
        A philosophy professor once stood up before his class with a large empty mayonnaise
        jar.<br>
        He filled the jar to the top with large rocks and asked his students if the jar was full. His students all
        agreed the jar was full.He then added small pebbles to the jar, and gave the jar a bit of a shake so the pebbles
        could disperse themselves among the larger rocks. Then he asked again, “Is the jar full now?”The students agreed
        that the jar was still full.The professor then poured sand into the jar to fill up all the remaining empty
        space.The students then agreed again that the jar was full.<br>
        The Metaphor:

        In this story, the jar represents your life and the rocks, pebbles, and sand are the things that fill up your
        life. The rocks represent the most important projects and things you have going on, such as spending time with
        your family and maintaining proper health. This means that if the pebbles and the sand were lost, the jar would
        still be full and your life would still have meaning.
        <br>
        The pebbles represent the things in your life that matter, but that you could live without. The pebbles are
        certainly things that give your life meaning (such as your job, house, hobbies, and friendships), but they are
        not critical for you to have a meaningful life. These things often come and go, and are not permanent or
        essential to your overall well-being.
        <br>
        Finally, the sand represents the remaining filler things in your life, and material possessions. This could be
        small things such as watching television, browsing through your favorite social media site, or running errands.
        These things don't mean much to your life as a whole, and are likely only done to waste time or get small tasks
        accomplished.
